Abstract of corresponding paper:
This research uses text-mining techniques to
assess emotions and topics in one-line jour-
nal entries to provide a preventative strat-
egy against harmful behavior. The main aim
is to establish how topic modeling and senti-
ment analysis utilize journal entries to provide
an overview of a groupâ€™s welfare. The mod-
els that were generated to establish this, were
RoBERTa for sentiment analysis and LDA for
topic modelling and they both yielded promis-
ing performances with a high accuracy. This
is why it was possible to create the final user-
based output based on these models, such as a
bar chart that displays the proportion of sen-
tences categorized under different sentiments
and a word cloud that displays the most fre-
quent words for the user. The achieved result
can be further explored with a wider selection
of features, such as time and date to allow a
fine-grained analysis to provide a more opti-
mal user output.
